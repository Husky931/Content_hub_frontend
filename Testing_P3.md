# P3 Manual Testing Plan

#### 1. Schema Migration (Sections 1–4)

After implementing each feature, run:

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit push
```

New tables/columns added:

- `messages.reply_to_id` — nullable FK to messages (Section 1)
- `channel_reads` table — userId + channelId + lastReadMessageId (Section 2)
- `users.language` — 'en' or 'zh' preference (Section 3)

#### 2. i18n Library (Section 3)

```bash
pnpm add next-intl
```

## 1. Reply Messages (Inline Threads)

### 1.1 Schema & API

- [ ] 1.1.1 `messages` table has new `reply_to_id` column (nullable FK to messages.id)
- [ ] 1.1.2 `POST /api/channels/[slug]/messages` accepts optional `replyToId` field
- [ ] 1.1.3 `GET /api/channels/[slug]/messages` returns `replyTo` object (id, content preview, author name) for reply messages
- [ ] 1.1.4 Sending a message with `replyToId` pointing to a deleted message → still saves (shows "Original message was deleted")
- [ ] 1.1.5 Sending a message with invalid `replyToId` → 400 error

### 1.2 Reply UI — Initiating a Reply

- [ ] 1.2.1 Hover over any message → "Reply" button appears in message action bar
- [ ] 1.2.2 Click Reply → reply preview bar appears above the message input (shows author name + first ~60 chars of original)
- [ ] 1.2.3 Reply preview bar has ✕ button to cancel reply
- [ ] 1.2.4 Can reply to own messages
- [ ] 1.2.5 Can reply to system messages
- [ ] 1.2.6 Reply preview bar persists while typing (doesn't disappear on focus change)

### 1.3 Reply UI — Display in Feed (Reddit-Style +/−)

By default, **replies are hidden from the main feed**. Parent messages with replies show a **[+] X replies** toggle. Clicking expands replies inline; clicking again (now **[−]**) collapses them back. Simple Reddit-style.

- [ ] 1.3.1 Reply messages are **not shown** in the main feed by default — only top-level messages appear
- [ ] 1.3.2 Messages that have replies show **[+] X replies** below the message (collapsed state)
- [ ] 1.3.3 Click [+] → replies expand inline below the parent, indented slightly with a left border
- [ ] 1.3.4 Toggle changes to **[−]** when expanded
- [ ] 1.3.5 Click [−] → replies collapse back, main feed is clean again
- [ ] 1.3.6 Expanded replies show in chronological order
- [ ] 1.3.7 Each reply shows author name + avatar + content (same style as regular messages, just indented)
- [ ] 1.3.8 If original parent message was deleted → replies still accessible (orphaned replies show "Original message was deleted")

### 1.4 Reply Messages — Real-Time

- [ ] 1.4.1 Tab A sends a reply → Tab B sees the reply count increment on the parent's [+] badge in real-time
- [ ] 1.4.2 If Tab B has replies expanded → new reply appears inline in real-time
- [ ] 1.4.3 If Tab B has replies collapsed → count updates without expanding

---

## 2. Channel Unread Badges

### 2.2 Sidebar Badge Display

- [ ] 2.2.1 Channels with unread messages show a red/white badge with count in the sidebar
- [ ] 2.2.2 Badge shows exact count up to 99, then "99+"
- [ ] 2.2.3 Channel name appears **bold** when there are unread messages
- [ ] 2.2.4 Currently active channel never shows unread badge (you're reading it)
- [ ] 2.2.5 Channels with 0 unread → no badge, normal weight text

### 2.3 Mark-Read Behavior

- [ ] 2.3.1 Navigate to a channel → unread badge clears immediately
- [ ] 2.3.2 Navigate away → new messages in that channel start accumulating as unread again
- [ ] 2.3.3 First time visiting a channel (no read record) → all messages are "read" (don't show 500 unread on first visit)
- [ ] 2.3.4 Multiple channels with unread → each shows independent count

### 2.4 Real-Time Badge Updates

- [ ] 2.4.1 Tab A is on #general, Tab B is on #feedback → Tab A sends message in #general → Tab B's sidebar shows unread badge on #general
- [ ] 2.4.2 Tab B navigates to #general → badge clears
- [ ] 2.4.3 System messages (task published, attempt submitted) also increment unread count
- [ ] 2.4.4 Multiple messages arrive while away → badge accumulates correctly

---

## 3. Internationalization (i18n)

### 3.1 Language Toggle & Preference

- [ ] 3.1.1 User dropdown (top-right) shows language toggle: EN / 中文
- [ ] 3.1.2 Clicking toggles the entire UI language immediately
- [ ] 3.1.3 Language preference saved to user record (`users.language` field, default 'en')
- [ ] 3.1.4 On login, UI loads in user's saved language
- [ ] 3.1.5 New users default to English

### 3.2 UI String Translation

- [ ] 3.2.1 Sidebar labels translated (Channels, Task Channels, Discussion, Settings, etc.)
- [ ] 3.2.2 Navbar elements translated (Notifications, Financials, Wallet, etc.)
- [ ] 3.2.3 Settings modal tabs and labels translated
- [ ] 3.2.4 Task-related UI translated (Submit Attempt, Approve, Reject, Review, etc.)
- [ ] 3.2.5 Onboarding flow translated (Welcome, Currency Selection, Profile Setup)
- [ ] 3.2.6 Error messages translated ("Invalid credentials", "File too large", etc.)
- [ ] 3.2.7 Empty states translated ("No messages yet", "No tasks available", etc.)
- [ ] 3.2.8 System messages translated ("New task published", "Attempt approved", etc.)

### 3.3 Content Localization (Existing CN Fields)

- [ ] 3.3.1 When language = 中文: channel names show `nameCn` (fallback to `name` if CN empty)
- [ ] 3.3.2 When language = 中文: channel descriptions show `descriptionCn`
- [ ] 3.3.3 When language = 中文: task titles show `titleCn` (fallback to `title`)
- [ ] 3.3.4 When language = 中文: task descriptions show `descriptionCn`
- [ ] 3.3.5 When language = 中文: tag names show `nameCn`
- [ ] 3.3.6 When language = EN: all fields show English versions (current behavior)

### 3.4 Currency Display

- [ ] 3.4.1 Creator sees bounty in their selected currency (already works from P1)
- [ ] 3.4.2 Currency symbol matches: $ for USD, ¥ for RMB
- [ ] 3.4.3 Financials page shows amounts in user's currency

---

## 4. Appeals System

### 4.1 Filing an Appeal (Creator)

- [ ] 4.1.1 When a creator's attempt is **rejected**, an "Appeal" button appears on the attempt
- [ ] 4.1.2 Click Appeal → modal/form opens asking for appeal reason (text, required, min 20 chars)
- [ ] 4.1.3 Submit appeal → `POST /api/appeals` creates record with status "pending"
- [ ] 4.1.4 Success message: "Appeal filed. A moderator will review it."
- [ ] 4.1.5 Appeal button replaced with "Appeal Pending" badge (disabled) after filing
- [ ] 4.1.6 Creator can file **only one appeal** per rejected attempt
- [ ] 4.1.7 If attempt is not rejected → Appeal button not shown
- [ ] 4.1.8 Unauthenticated → 401, wrong user → 403

### 4.2 Appeal Queue — #appeals Channel (Mod/Supermod/Admin)

Appeals live in the **#appeals** special channel. When a creator files an appeal, it appears as a special appeal card in this channel.

- [ ] 4.2.1 #appeals channel shows appeal cards (not regular messages) — each card is a pending appeal
- [ ] 4.2.2 Filing an appeal posts an appeal card to #appeals: task title, creator name, filed date, reason preview
- [ ] 4.2.3 Filing an appeal triggers an **unread badge** on #appeals for all mods/supermods/admins
- [ ] 4.2.4 Click "Review" on an appeal card → expands inline to show: original task details, rejection reason, creator's appeal reason
- [ ] 4.2.5 Expanded review shows: the submission (deliverables with file previews — images, audio, video)
- [ ] 4.2.6 Arbitration notes textarea for the reviewer
- [ ] 4.2.7 Two action buttons: "Uphold Appeal" (green) and "Deny Appeal" (red)
- [ ] 4.2.8 Creators can see their own appeals in #appeals (read-only, no action buttons) — cannot see other creators' appeals
- [ ] 4.2.9 Resolved appeal cards show "Granted" / "Denied" badge and collapse to a summary

### 4.3 Resolving an Appeal

- [ ] 4.3.1 **Uphold Appeal** → attempt status changes from "rejected" back to "submitted" (re-enters review queue)
- [ ] 4.3.2 Upheld appeal → task status returns to "active" if it was moved past active
- [ ] 4.3.3 Upheld appeal → system message in the **task's original channel**: "Appeal upheld for [creator] on [task] — re-submitted for review"
- [ ] 4.3.4 Upheld appeal → notification sent to creator: "Your appeal was upheld"
- [ ] 4.3.5 **Deny Appeal** → appeal status set to "denied", attempt stays rejected
- [ ] 4.3.6 Denied appeal → notification sent to creator: "Your appeal was denied"
- [ ] 4.3.7 Both actions record arbitratorId, arbitratorNote, resolvedAt
- [ ] 4.3.8 Resolved appeals show in #appeals with "Granted" / "Denied" badge (greyed out, not actionable)

### 4.4 Appeal API

- [ ] 4.4.1 `POST /api/appeals` — create appeal (creator only, one per attempt, attempt must be rejected)
- [ ] 4.4.2 `GET /api/appeals` — list appeals (mod/supermod/admin, filter by status)
- [ ] 4.4.3 `PATCH /api/appeals/[id]` — resolve appeal (mod/supermod/admin, status: granted/denied)
- [ ] 4.4.4 Duplicate appeal for same attempt → 400 "Appeal already exists"
- [ ] 4.4.5 Resolve already-resolved appeal → 400 "Appeal already resolved"

## 5. 48-Hour Lock Mechanism

### 5.1 Locking a Task (Mod Action)

- [ ] 5.1.1 In review, mod sees a near-perfect attempt → "Lock for Revision" button appears alongside Approve/Reject
- [ ] 5.1.2 Click Lock → confirmation dialog: "Lock task for [creator] for 48h exclusive revision?"
- [ ] 5.1.3 Confirm → task status changes from ACTIVE → LOCKED
- [ ] 5.1.4 `lockedById` set to the creator's userId, `lockExpiresAt` set to now + 48 hours
- [ ] 5.1.5 System message in channel: "Task locked for [creator] — 48h exclusive revision"
- [ ] 5.1.6 Notification sent to locked creator: "You have 48h to revise your submission for [task]"
- [ ] 5.1.7 Other creators see task card as "LOCKED" with orange lock icon

### 5.2 Locked Task Behavior

- [ ] 5.2.1 Locked creator can submit revision attempts (new deliverables)
- [ ] 5.2.2 Revision attempts do NOT count against maxAttempts
- [ ] 5.2.3 Other creators CANNOT submit attempts → shows "Task locked for revision" message
- [ ] 5.2.4 Task card shows orange "LOCKED" badge + countdown timer (hours:minutes remaining)
- [ ] 5.2.5 Timer updates in real-time (every minute refresh or JS countdown)

### 5.3 Lock Resolution

- [ ] 5.3.1 Creator submits revision → mod reviews → can Approve (LOCKED → APPROVED) or Reject
- [ ] 5.3.2 If mod rejects during lock → task stays LOCKED, creator can try again (within 48h)
- [ ] 5.3.3 Lock expires (48h passes) → next task query auto-transitions LOCKED → ACTIVE
- [ ] 5.3.4 After auto-unlock: task open for everyone again, system message: "Lock expired — task reopened"
- [ ] 5.3.5 Mod can manually unlock early → LOCKED → ACTIVE, system message: "Task unlocked by [mod]"

### 5.4 Lock Expiry Check (Lazy Evaluation)

- [ ] 5.4.1 `GET /api/tasks` checks any LOCKED tasks where `lockExpiresAt < now()` → auto-updates to ACTIVE
- [ ] 5.4.2 Channel page load also triggers the lazy check
- [ ] 5.4.3 No cron job needed — expiry resolved on next read
- [ ] 5.4.4 After auto-unlock, lockedById and lockExpiresAt are cleared

### 5.5 Lock API

- [ ] 5.5.1 `POST /api/tasks/[taskId]/lock` — lock task for a specific creator (mod/supermod/admin only)
- [ ] 5.5.2 `POST /api/tasks/[taskId]/unlock` — manually unlock (mod/supermod/admin only)
- [ ] 5.5.3 Lock on non-active task → 400 "Can only lock active tasks"
- [ ] 5.5.4 Unlock on non-locked task → 400 "Task is not locked"
- [ ] 5.5.5 Submit attempt on locked task by wrong creator → 403 "Task is locked for another creator"

### 6.2 Using Templates in Task Creation

- [ ] 6.2.1 Task creation form has "Template" dropdown (first field)
- [ ] 6.2.2 Select a template → form pre-fills: description, checklist, bounty, file type constraints
- [ ] 6.2.3 Admin can still edit all pre-filled fields before publishing
- [ ] 6.2.4 Task saves a snapshot of the template in `templateData` JSONB (decoupled from template changes)
- [ ] 6.2.5 Creating a task without a template still works as before

### 6.3 Template API

- [ ] 6.3.1 `GET /api/templates` — list all templates
- [ ] 6.3.2 `POST /api/templates` — create template (admin/supermod only)
- [ ] 6.3.3 `PATCH /api/templates/[id]` — update template
